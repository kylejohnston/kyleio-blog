I created MEMEX as a tool to gather design inspiration. For years, I had used tools like Pinterest or standalone macOS apps to gather inspiration, but they were either too complicated or a pain to manage. 

I just wanted something where I could drag-and-drop files into a folder and see them on a webpage. When I discovered PHP had a relatively simple method to support this, MEMEX was born. 

<Image src={visual} alt="MEMEX page" />

I run a local version of the site that's always up-to-date (and speedy), and I keep a public version updated so I can browse for inspiration when I'm away from home.

Since creating MEMEX in 2018, I've restructured the nav several times, randomized the image rendering, added an inbox, and more. I've also added a few LLM-assisted features, like image counts for each page, and index pages that combine all of the subdirectories for my largest categories.

There's a  [colophon](https://memex.flow14.com/colophon.php) if you're curious about the design and tooling. And I keep a [changelog](https://memex.flow14.com/colophon.php) to track how the site has evolved.
The [sourcecode is available on GitHub](https://github.com/kylejohnston/memex) and there's even a  [boilerplate version](https://github.com/kylejohnston/memex-core) if you want to roll your own.
