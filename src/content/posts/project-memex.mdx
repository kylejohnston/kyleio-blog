I created MEMEX as a tool to gather design inspiration. For years, I had used tools like Pinterest or standalone macOS apps to gather inspiration, but they were either too complex, too basic, too expensive; the list goes on.

I run a local version of the site that's always up-to-date (and speedy). I also maintain [a public version](https://memex.flow14.com) so I can browse for inspiration when I'm away from home.


If you're curious about the design and tooling, there's [a colophon](https://memex.flow14.com/colophon.php). And I keep [a changelog](https://memex.flow14.com/colophon.php) to track how the site is evolving. The [source code is available on GitHub](https://github.com/kylejohnston/memex) and there's even a  [boilerplate version](https://github.com/kylejohnston/memex-core) if you want to roll your own version.
