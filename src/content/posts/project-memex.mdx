I created MEMEX as a tool to gather design inspiration. For years, I had used tools like Pinterest or standalone macOS apps to gather inspiration, but they were either too complex, too basic, too expensive; the list goes on.

I wanted something where I could drop some images into a folder and see them in a browser. When I discovered PHP had a relatively simple method to support this, MEMEX was born.

<Image src={art} alt="MEMEX, art & illustration page" class="border border-neutral-200 rounded-sm" />

<Image src={nav} alt="MEMEX, navigation" class="border border-neutral-200 rounded-sm" />
<p class="caption">[Navigation view](https://memex.flow14.com/all.php#menu)</p>

I run a local version of the site that's always up-to-date (and speedy), and I maintain [a public version](https://memex.flow14.com) so I can browse for inspiration when I'm away from home.

Since creating MEMEX in 2018, I've restructured the nav several times, randomized the image rendering, added an inbox, and more. I've also added a few LLM-assisted features, like displaying image counts for each page, and index pages that combine all of the subdirectories for my largest categories, [visual design](https://memex.flow14.com/design.php) and [web design](https://memex.flow14.com/websites.php).

If you're curious about the design and tooling, there's [a colophon](https://memex.flow14.com/colophon.php). And I keep [a changelog](https://memex.flow14.com/colophon.php) to track how the site is evolving. The [source code is available on GitHub](https://github.com/kylejohnston/memex) and there's even a  [boilerplate version](https://github.com/kylejohnston/memex-core) if you want to roll your own version.
