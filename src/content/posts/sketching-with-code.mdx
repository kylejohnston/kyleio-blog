I’ve been spending some of my free time sketching in code using Processing and the Hype library. There are tons or resources and inspiration out there, but I’ve learned a lot by joining [Joshua Davis’](https://joshuadavis.com/) Patreon page, where he shares the methods to his generative art madness. His lessons helped me generate this video:

## Color, texture, and algorithm
One of takeaways I especially liked from Josh's tutorials was the idea that you can generate endless number of patterns by manipulating three variables: (1) color, (2) texture, and (3) the algorithm.

To speed up my process, I’ve started to build a library of colors and textures I can use in my code sketches. When I have time to create a new sketch, I grab a few elements from my library and jump right into code. Like anything else, when you start to look for inspiration, you’ll see it everywhere.

### Color
My color inspiration came from the plethora of Apple logos created to promote an October 2018 event. I had saved of number of the logos from [this gallery](https://imgur.com/a/all-of-apple-logos-from-october-30th-event-invites-ufybGk6), so I picked three of my favorites, created gradient scales in Figma, then output those gradients as PNGs.

### Texture
My texture inspiration came from a case study of Uber’s 2018 rebrand. I spotted a cool tile pattern in one of the photos featured in their photography guidelines, and created several graphics based on those patterns.

	</div>

### Algorithm
Using my colors and textures and the code Josh shared, I started playing with different combinations of elements until I found one I liked. You can find [my final source code on GitHub](https://github.com/kylejohnston/code-sketches/blob/master/09_texture/tx0001/build/build.pde).

## Turning a Processing sketch into a video
There are a number of ways to generate a video from a Processing sketch; my current preferred technique is using a snippet of code that exports each frame of the sketch as a high-res image. I wasn’t exactly sure how many frames it would take to create a usable video, so I started by exporting 5,000 jpegs. After ~12 minutes of render time, I looked through the jpegs to find a good stopping point for my video — frame 2,580 was the winner. It’s easily divisible by 30 and 60, which is great for my purposes because 1 frame = 1 second of video. Simple math!

I trashed the jpegs, changed the output format to TIFF (for a crisp, high-res image) and output my images. 2 minutes later, I had 2,580 TIFFs ready to use.

I like to use Adobe Premiere to create my videos because it gives me a lot of control over outputs and effects. I start by importing all the TIFFs into Premiere, add those to the timeline, set the frame duration to 1 second, then export a video. I’m still trying to find a combination of export settings that I’m happy with; so far starting with Premiere’s default settings for Vimeo and changing VBR to 2-pass has delivered the best results. In this case, the result is this slow-paced video:

To make things more interesting, I import my first video into a new Premiere project. Now, I can play with the playback speed, visual effects (mirroring is always fun to try), and color treatments. In this case, I changed the duration to 10 seconds, which dramatically speeds up the animation, and exported a new video (using the same settings from the first pass), resulting in my final video:

<Vimeo id="https://vimeo.com/298098588" />

## It’s just that easy!
Once you get the steps down, this is a relatively quick process — and the possibilities are endless. If you think it looks interesting, I highly encourage you to jump in and try it for yourself. Josh’s Patreon posts are a great starting point and cover everything you need to get started.

Happy sketching!
