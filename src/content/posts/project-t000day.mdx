[t000.day](https://t000.day/) is a single-serving site that answers a simple question: what day of the year is it?

<div class="flex flex-row gap-2 wide">
	<div>
		<Image src={past} alt="Back in time" class="border border-neutral-200 rounded-sm" />
	</div>
	<div>
		<Image src={present} alt="Today's day" class="border border-neutral-200 rounded-sm" />
	</div>
	<div>
		<Image src={future} alt="Future" class="border border-neutral-200 rounded-sm" />
	</div>
</div>

The idea for this site was inspired by a frustration with my 365 photo project. I would occasionally lose track of the day and wanted a quick and simple way to get back on track. While there are sites with the information, they're often either poorly designed or loaded down with extra content, like ads. 

## How I used AI
When LLM-based coding tools became available, I used ChatGPT to turn my idea into a simple, working site. Since launching, I've continued to add a few quality-of-life features, like URL parsing. Now, I can append any date to the URL (starting in [1900](https://t000.day/1900-01-01)) and see what the day was (or [will be](https://t000.day/2096-04-10)).
