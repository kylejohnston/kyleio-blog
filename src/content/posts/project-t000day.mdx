[t000.day](https://t000.day/) is a single-serving site that answers a simple question: what day of the year is it?

<div class="flex flex-row gap-2 wide">
	<div>
		<Image src={past} alt="Back in time" class="border border-neutral-200 rounded-sm" />
	</div>
	<div>
		<Image src={present} alt="Today's day" class="border border-neutral-200 rounded-sm" />
	</div>
	<div>
		<Image src={future} alt="Future" class="border border-neutral-200 rounded-sm" />
	</div>
</div>

The idea for this project was inspired by a frustration with my 365 photo project. Occasionally, I would lose track of the day and I needed a quick and simple way to get back on track. There are plenty sites with this information, but they're often either (A) poorly designed or (B) loaded down with extra content like ads. 

## How LLMs unlocked this project
When LLM-based coding tools hit the scene, I dusted off this idea and used ChatGPT to turn it into a super-simple, working site. Under the hood, it's bascially an HTML file with few JavaScript functions. The JavaScript determines the date, adds the correct suffix, and renders it on the page.

Since launching, I've added a few quality-of-life features, like parsing the day based on the URL. Now, I can add any date to the URL (starting in [1900](https://t000.day/1900-01-01)) and see what the day was (or [will be](https://t000.day/2096-04-10)). I have redesign planned with some ideas to make bits of the UI change based on the current day.
