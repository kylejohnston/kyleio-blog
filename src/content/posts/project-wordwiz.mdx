[WordWiz](https://wordwiz.xyz/) is a word game I created in 2024. It's a simple game where you choose a letter then add as many words as you can think of that start with that letter.

## The concept
The idea for the game was inspired by a newly-retired family member who wanted a fun, casual way to keep their mind sharp, but didn't like the competitiveness or complexity of other popular word games.

## How LLMs unlocked this project
We had joked about finding a game where you type as many words as you could think of. I built a simple proof of concept with ChatGPT to test the mechanics of the idea. From that seed, I quickly iterated and added features like score tracking, an optional timer, and motivational phrases provided by [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/).

Once the core features were in place, I took over and customized the design. I created a logo and color scheme and optimized the design for desktop and mobile browsers. The game was well-received and at least one person in the world enjoys playing it each day!
