TIL you can greatly improve the quality of an answer you get from an LLM if you  include this in your prompt: `Before you give me the answer, ask me everything you need to know to give me the best result possible.` 

Using this technique, I've found cases where I had the answer all along and explaining things to the LLM helped me find it. Which I've since learned is basically [rubber duck programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging).
