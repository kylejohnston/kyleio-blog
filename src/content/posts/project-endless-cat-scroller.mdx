This project started with a thought captured in my spark file: [Endless Doom Scroller](https://endlessdoomscroller.com/), but kittens?

That thought lingered in my spark file until [Claude Code on the Web](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/claude-code-on-the-web) came along. This project felt like a perfect way to kick the tires.

I started with a [design doc](https://github.com/kylejohnston/endlessmewscroller/blob/main/docs/plans/2025-11-13-endless-cat-scroller-design.md)—created with the help of [Obra’s superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers)—and pointed Claude Code Web to a fresh repo with this prompt: `Follow the design doc in this repo and create a working prototype. The preferred API is cataas.com. But I may want to test thecatapi.com. Any questions?`

I answered a few questions, went to sleep while Claude churned, and woke up to a working prototype! Exciting? Ye… not so fast! 

Before declaring it a one shot, I tried a new prompt shared by a [distinguished engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasmus_Lerdorf) at work: `If you were going to re-implement this entire feature we added on this branch cleanly, which findings were non-obvious or surprising and what would you do differently?`

Claude’s responses were surprising:
1. I’m not actually using the API properly (Biggest issue!)
2. Didn’t implement srcset (You specifically asked for it!)

Oh my. That day, I learned Claude Code Web isn’t as diligent about following design docs as its CLI counterpart. After a few more rounds of prompts to resolve the issues followed by design refinements, the Endless Mew Scroller launched.

Now, if you need a break from the algorithmic feeds, you can scroll cats!
