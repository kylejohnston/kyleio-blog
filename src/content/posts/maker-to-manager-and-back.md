I recently read a post on managers learning to measure their own success. It nicely captures a sentiment that played a role in my decision to turn in my manager badge and return to the maker's path. 

> One of the things that new managers often find distressing is the sudden inability to identify the progress of their own work. …you become a manager and suddenly the measure of your success is…what, exactly?

==*Cut this paragraph?* ==
I started my career as a designer and I shifted into management pretty early. Eventually, I progressed to director roles, which included managing other managers.

## The salad days
In my management salad days, one of my goals was to create the conditions for my team to do their best work. If the team or individuals on the team were successful, that was a win for me. The work was stressful at times and the outcomes weren't always obvious on a day-to-day basis. But knowing I played a role in shaping the work and helping people identify and achieve their goals was rewarding. I never imagined leaving that path. But then came…

## The dark days
In the dark days of management – my last director-level role – my output was measured in how many hours I spent in meetings or how many times I revised a presentation or budget.  

Even if I looked at my output from a broader perspective and a longer time horizon – which is an important perspective at that level – any progress made on a big-picture strategy or annual/quarterly goals could be wiped out in a day by a shift in business or macroeconomic conditions that were outside of my control.

## The switch back
Eventually, those business conditions 'impacted' my role. As I contemplated the prospect of pursuing another leadership role, the *possibility* that it might include activities like endless budget revisions, weighing different ways to cut headcount, or spending  hours in poorly-run meetings, I knew that path wasn't for me anymore. It was time for a change.

I made the decision to return to the maker's path, but now I have the experience and perspective of a manager. I know what I'm 'missing' and at the end of a workday I can reliably identify a tangible outcome. That might include something I designed or coded, a client I helped, or someone I coached. People have called it a brave decision. I never saw it that way. It was a decision to prioritize my mental health and happiness, which made it the obvious choice.
