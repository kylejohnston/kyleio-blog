Hello! I'm Kyle Johnston. I'm based in the Kansas City area where I spend my days as a staff product designer at Etsy. Prior to Etsy, I ran my own design studio, [flow14](https://www.flow14.com/). Before *that*, I worked for a range of companies – from startups to agencies to big companies like Garmin. You can find my professional design portfolio at [kylejohnston.com](https://www.kylewjohnston.com/) or check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kylejohnston/).

This site is a creative journal of things that spark my curiosity, including [projects](/t/project), [posts](/t/post), and [discoveries](/t/til).

### What's with the 'IO'?
In computer terms, IO (or I/O) stands for input and output. This site represents a collection of inputs (ideas, projects I've built to inform my work) and outputs (thoughts and things I've made).

## Colophon (aka how this is all made)
- Designed, developed, and written by me
- Designed in Figma · [Source](https://www.figma.com/design/iojKTp83iYmleVE22Q0ey6/kyleio?node-id=1-3&t=1QmgUQ7CIsUnLzwY-1)
- Built with [Astro](https://astro.build/), a web framework I started using in 2022-ish. For whatever reason, it clicks with my brain, so it's the tool I reach for when I need a static site that requires more than basic HTML and CSS.
- VS Code is my editor of choice. And for the first time, GitHub Copilot was pretty useful in this project. 
- [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) hosts the site and handles automatic builds and deployments through a connection with my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/kylejohnston/kyleio-blog).
- Typography is [IBM Plex Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Sans) for text, [Ginestra](https://tipografiaginestra.com/) for post titles, and dashes of [IBM Plex Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Mono) because I'm a sucker for monospaced fonts.
- This version of the site (the first!) launched in June 2025.

Thanks for visiting!
