This is a web-based project I created to support a concept I have for an art project. The visualize allows me to play with the parameters of a spiral and see how they affect the overall shape. Once I find a shape I like, I can export it as an SVG and to use in other contexts.

## What's a Vogel Spiral?
A Vogel spiral is a pattern of points spiraling outward in a very natural, super-efficient way, based on the golden angle. It was described by the German biophysicist [Helmut Vogel](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0025556479900804) in 1979 when he was modeling sunflower seed arrangements.
