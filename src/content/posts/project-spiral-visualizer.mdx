This is a web-based project I created (with the help of an LLM) to support a concept I have for an art project. The controls allow me to play with the parameters of a Vogel spiral and see how they affect the overall shape. Once I find a shape I like, I can export it as an SVG to use in other contexts.

## How I used AI
I had tried to create something on my own with [Processing](https://processing.org/) but never had much luck with producing the fine-grained controls. When I discovered [Claude Artifacts](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/9487310-what-are-artifacts-and-how-do-i-use-them), I was able to build a web-based tool with a few simple prompts. Once the bones were in place, I took over and customized the design, defaults, and outputs to suit the needs of my project. 

## What's a Vogel Spiral?
A Vogel spiral is a pattern of points spiraling outward in a very natural, super-efficient way, based on the golden angle. It was described by the German biophysicist [Helmut Vogel](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0025556479900804) in 1979 when he was modeling sunflower seed arrangements.
