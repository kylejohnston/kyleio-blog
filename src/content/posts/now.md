## June 2025
### Work
I spend my days as a staff product designer at Etsy. Currently, my squad is focused on improving the web homepage. I also collaborate with local nonprofits and friends to bring their ideas to life on the web.
### Life
I'm based in the Kansas City area. Specifically, on the Kansas side in a suburb called Overland Park. When I'm not designing for a living, I enjoy designing and coding for fun. When I'm away from my computer, I've been enjoying walking (and trying to get into a running habit).
