## June 2025
### Work
I spend my days as a staff product designer at Etsy. Currently, my squad is focused on improving the web homepage. I also collaborate with local nonprofits and friends to bring their ideas to life on the web.
### Projects
Using the output of my [spiral visualizer project](/p/project-spiral-visualizer) to create a physical piece of art
### AI
It's solidly in the ['we'll see'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JC9CrNTT6Uk) category for me. It's not the everything engine. It's not useless.

I've used it to successfully code [projects](/t/project/) that would never have seen the light of day without the ability to move from idea to working code in a short exchange. Other use cases: proofreader. Vim debugger. [Rubber duck debugger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging). I don't use it for generating images, designs, or original writing.
