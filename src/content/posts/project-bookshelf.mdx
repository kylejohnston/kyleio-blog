I created a bookshelf to track the books I've read since I started tracking my reading in 2009-ish. It's a completely custom design, built with [Astro](https://astro.build/), my current favorite web framework.

Since launching the site in 2022, I've continued to tinker with it and add features. I've added search, pagination, page transitions, [a list view](https://books.kyleio.com/list), and more.

If you're curious about the design and tooling, [the about page](https://books.kyleio.com/about) has all the details. And [the code is available on GitHub](https://github.com/kylejohnston/astro_bookshelf)
