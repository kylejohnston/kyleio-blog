I created a bookshelf to track the books I've read since I started tracking my reading in 2009-ish. It's a custom design, built with [Astro](https://astro.build/), my current favorite web framework.

<div class="flex flex-row gap-2 wide">
	<div>
		<Image src={desktop} alt="My bookshelf, desktop" class="border border-neutral-200 rounded-sm shadow-xl" />
	</div>
	<div>
		<Image src={mweb} alt="My bookshelf, mweb" class="border border-neutral-200 rounded-sm shadow-xl" />
	</div>
</div>
<p class="caption">Homepage · [View the project](https://books.kyleio.com/) · [GitHub repo](https://github.com/kylejohnston/astro_bookshelf)</p>

<div class="flex flex-row gap-2">
	<div>
		<Image src={bookPageDesktop} alt="Book detail page, desktop" class="border border-neutral-200 rounded-sm" />
	</div>
	<div>
		<Image src={bookPageMweb} alt="Book detail page, mweb" class="border border-neutral-200 rounded-sm" />
	</div>
</div>
<p class="caption">[Book detail page](https://books.kyleio.com/book/the-creative-act)</p>

Since launching the site in 2022, I've continued to tinker with it and add features. I've added search, pagination, page transitions, [a list view](https://books.kyleio.com/list), and more.

If you're curious about the design and tooling, [the about page](https://books.kyleio.com/about) has all the details. And [the source code is available on GitHub](https://github.com/kylejohnston/astro_bookshelf).
