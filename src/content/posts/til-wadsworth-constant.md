> **The Wadsworth Constant says that you can safely skip the first 30% of anything you see online.** (It was meant for YouTube videos, but it applies just as well to writing).  
> This is one of those annoying pieces of advice that remains applicable even after you know it. Somehow, whenever I finish a draft, my first few paragraphs almost always contain ideas that were necessary for writing the rest of the piece, but that aren’t necessary for understanding it. It’s like I’m giving someone a tour of my hometown and I start by showing them all the dead ends.  

Via this excellent post, [28 slightly rude notes on writing](https://www.experimental-history.com/p/28-slightly-rude-notes-on-writing).

Soon after I learned about the Wadsworth Constant, I spotted it in a [big list of eponymous laws](https://www.secretorum.life/p/the-grand-encyclopedia-of-eponymous).

This *also* relates to a communication principle from the military I learned recently, [BLUF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLUF_(communication)), or bottom line up front. Meaning communicate key information *first*. Which goes against the Wadwworth Constant, but now those ideas are connected in my mind.
